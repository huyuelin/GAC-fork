## 💡 What is GAC?

Hybrid SFT–RL post-training is the standard recipe for aligning LLMs — but the *mixing weight* **μ** between the two signals is almost always a **fixed, hand-tuned schedule**. This is fragile: when RL noise spikes, or when the SFT expert starts pulling the policy in a wrong direction, a static μ over-commits to whichever side is currently *less* reliable.

**GAC solves this by treating μ as an estimation problem.**

We derive a closed-form optimal μ that minimizes the MSE of the composite gradient under a signal-vs-noise decomposition:

<div align="center">

**μ\* = ( α<sub>tgt</sub>·Δg² + σ<sub>r</sub>² ) / ( Δg² + σ<sub>s</sub>² + σ<sub>r</sub>² )**

</div>

where **σ<sub>s</sub>², σ<sub>r</sub>²** are SFT and RL noise variances and **Δg²** is the SFT–RL disagreement. Since gradient-level quantities are prohibitively expensive at every step, we deploy three **coefficient-space proxies** estimated online from tensors any GRPO/PPO trainer already computes, wrapped in EMA smoothing, a cosine-schedule prior, and per-step change capping.

**Bottom line**: **+3.8 pp over HPT** (the previous best hybrid post-training method) averaged over math, code, science, and logic benchmarks, with **< 1% wall-time overhead**, **28% lower KL-drift area**, and gains that **grow with model scale** from 1.5B → 14B.

---

## ✨ Key Highlights

- 🎯 **Closed-form μ\***, derived from MSE-optimal gradient estimation — no meta-learning, no bilevel optimization, no extra hyperparameter grid.
- 📉 **Coefficient-space proxies**: three cheap signals (`σ_s²`, `σ_r²`, `Δg̃²`) that any PPO/GRPO trainer already has on hand.
- 🛡️ **Guarded controller stack**: EMA smoothing → cosine-prior blend → per-step change cap → hard clipping. Robust to mid-training regime shifts.
- ⚡ **< 1% wall-time overhead**: proxies are computed inside the existing forward pass, no extra network eval.
- 📈 **Consistent gains across scales**: **+2.2 pp @ 1.5B**, **+3.8 pp @ 7B**, **+3.3 pp @ 14B** on AMC vs. HPT (paper Table 3).
- 🔬 **Length-invariant by construction**: each sequence contributes exactly one scalar per proxy, so longer rollouts don't get extra vote weight.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepnovacore/GAC.git
cd GAC
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

The controller has **no framework-specific dependencies** beyond PyTorch. `torch.distributed` is used only if you have multi-GPU.

### Minimal integration (5 lines)

Drop the controller into any hybrid SFT–RL loop:

```python
from gac import AdaptiveMuController
from gac.sft_loss import SFTPhiLossFn
from gac.hybrid_loss import compute_hybrid_loss
from gac.controller import mu_schedule

controller = AdaptiveMuController(
    ema_beta=0.99,
    mu_change_cap=0.01,
    trim_ratio_sft=0.10,
    mu_update_freq=10,
    alpha_static=0.5,
)
sft_loss_fn = SFTPhiLossFn(token_level=True)

def training_step(batch, global_step, rl_loss_fn):
    # cosine-schedule prior on μ (peak → valley over training)
    prior = mu_schedule(
        global_step,
        warmup_steps=200, decay_steps=800,
        mu_peak=0.85, mu_valley=0.15,
    )
    # μ is inferred inside compute_hybrid_loss via the controller
    loss, logs = compute_hybrid_loss(
        logprob=batch["logprob"],
        action_mask=batch["action_mask"],
        advantages=batch["advantages"],
        expert_mask=batch["expert_mask"],
        rl_loss_fn=rl_loss_fn,          # your favorite PPO / GRPO surrogate
        sft_loss_fn=sft_loss_fn,
        controller=controller,
        global_step=global_step,
        schedule_prior=prior,
        blend_weight=0.5,               # λ in the paper — cosine-prior blend
    )
    return loss, logs
```

That's it. GAC only touches the **weighting between** the SFT and RL losses; it does not modify either loss itself. You keep your PPO / GRPO implementation, your RL infrastructure, and your reward model unchanged.

## 🛠️ Reproducing Paper Results

> **⚠️ Status (2026-08)**: This repo currently ships the **reference algorithm** — controller, hybrid-loss integration point, unit tests, and default config matching the paper. **Full training scripts, evaluation pipeline, and pretrained checkpoints are landing in v0.2 (targeted for late 2026-09).** See the [Roadmap](#-roadmap) section below.

For now, you can reproduce the *algorithm* end-to-end by wiring GAC into any GRPO/PPO trainer of your choice (VeRL, TRL, OpenRLHF, Trinity-RFT). The `configs/gac_default.yaml` gives you every hyperparameter in the paper's Sec. 4.1.

### Default hyperparameters

| Symbol | Config key | Value | Paper Sec. |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|
| β (EMA) | `ema_beta` | 0.99 | 3.4 |
| c̄ (per-step cap) | `mu_change_cap` | 0.01 | 3.4 |
| λ (cosine-prior blend) | `blend_weight` | 0.50 | 3.4 |
| f<sub>μ</sub> (update freq.) | `mu_update_freq` | 10 | 3.3 |
| trim ratio (SFT) | `trim_ratio_sft` | 0.10 | 3.3 |
| KL target | `kl_target` | 0.02 | 3.3 |
| α range | `alpha_range` | [0.10, 0.95] | 3.3 |

### Datasets used in the paper

| Domain | Dataset | Split |
|---|---|---|
| Math | OpenR1-Math-220k | 5k SFT prompts + 20k RL prompts |
| Code | MBPP, HumanEval | full eval |
| Science | GPQA, SciBench | full eval |
| Logic | BBH (logical subsets) | full eval |

All main results report **mean ± std over 3 seeds** with joint significance thresholds **p < 0.05** and **Cohen's d > 0.8**.

## 📐 Method

The controller performs three operations per update:

**1. Proxy estimation** *(Sec. 3.2 of the paper)*

| Symbol | Meaning | Length-invariant? |
|---|---|:---:|
| σ<sub>r</sub>² | Variance of *sequence-level* GRPO-normalized advantages across the batch. **Post-normalization dispersion**, not raw reward variance. | ✅ |
| σ<sub>s</sub>² | Tail-trimmed variance of length-normalized per-sequence NLL on expert samples. | ✅ |
| Δg̃² | Mean squared coefficient mismatch between SFT and RL token-level gradient coefficients on shared response tokens, after within-batch z-normalization. | ✅ |

**2. Closed-form aggregation** into μ\*:

<div align="center">

μ\* = ( α<sub>tgt</sub>·Δg̃² + σ<sub>r</sub>² ) / ( Δg̃² + σ<sub>s</sub>² + σ<sub>r</sub>² )

</div>

**3. Guarded update**:

```
raw_μ*  →  EMA(β)  →  blend(λ) with cosine prior  →  clip |Δμ| ≤ c̄  →  clip to [μ_min, μ_max]
```

Detailed derivation (including the MSE minimization, the proxy-vs-oracle validation, and length-invariance proofs) is in **[docs/method.md](docs/method.md)** and Appendices A–D of the paper.
